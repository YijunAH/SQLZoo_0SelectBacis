Select within select tutorial
# This tutorial looks at how we can use SELECT statements within SELECT statements to perform more complex queries.

# 1. Bigger than Russian
# List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'.

SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE population >
     (SELECT population FROM world
      WHERE name='Russia')

# 2. Richer than UK
# Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.

SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE continent='Europe' and  gdp/population>
     (SELECT gdp/population FROM world
      WHERE name='United Kingdom')

# 3. Neighbors of Argentina and Australia
# List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.

select name, continent from world where continent in (select continent from world where name= 'Argentina' or name= 'Australia') order by name

# 4. Between Canada and Poland
# Which country has a population that is more than Canada but less than Poland? Show the name and the population.

select name, population from world where population>(select population from world where name='Canada') and population <(select population from world where name='Poland')

# 5. Percentages of Germany
# Germany (population 80 million) has the largest population of the countries in Europe. Austria (population 8.5 million) has 11% of the population of Germany.

# Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.

select name,
concat(round((100*population/(select population from world where name='Germany'))), '%') as percentages_of_Germany
from world
where continent='Europe'

# 6. Bigger than every country in Europe
# Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)

select name from world where gdp>ALL(select gdp from world where continent='Europe' and gdp>0)

# 7. Largest in each continent
# Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:

SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
  WHERE area >= ALL
    (SELECT area FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND area>0)

# 8. First country of each continent (alphabetically)
# List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.

SELECT continent, name FROM world x
  WHERE name <= ALL
    (SELECT name FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent)

# 9. Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.

select name, continent, population
from world x 
where 25000000 > ALL(SELECT population FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent and population >0)

# 10. Some countries have populations more than three times that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.

select name, continent
from world x 
where (population/3) > ALL(SELECT population FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent and population >0 and y.name != x.name)

select name, continent
from world x 
where population > ALL(SELECT 3*population FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent and population >0 and y.name != x.name)
